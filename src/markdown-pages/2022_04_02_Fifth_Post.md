Andrew and I did Willy's Wide at Arapahoe Basin today and holy Willy that was hard. The view and the skiing made it so rewarding, and it gives me a benchmark of where I am, and where I want to be physically. 

It's 600 feet of verticle gain, and we did it twice! I was really nervous for the first time, and was getting flustered at the start. My skis were tough to carry -- they didn't really lock together nicely and started to seperate in the wind. We had a big group in front and behind us, and let one of them pass us, but we were all struggling at the top. That last ~100 feet or so was brutal and steep. The boot pack was kind of icy, and hard to get some good footing. BUT making it to the top section, and standing on the little ledge, was such a feeling. I honestly wanted to stop and ski down from where I was, but seeing Andrew crushing it, and hearing him encourage me, made me want to finish it for him. There were a lot of people at the top, but we put our skis on right away to get away from the crowd and make more room. Andrew went over a few things before going down, like where some rocks might be, then we dropped, and those first few turns were so soft. The snow was honestly so nice the whole way down, just a few weird icy sections. 

The second time, I was DYING. In a good way. I honestly don't know what I thought it would be like, and think I forgot how hard the first time was. We did a run off of Pali in between, to loosen our legs a little bit, then took Lenawee up to the East Wall Traverse. We took that to the base of Willy's Wide, and only one person was there. We started up and I feel like my skis held together better this time around.
