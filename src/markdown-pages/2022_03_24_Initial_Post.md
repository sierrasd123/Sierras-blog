Welcome to my first blog! Shout-out to Andrew for making this happen.

I really just want to document my time in Colorado and try to make the most out of it while we're here. I feel like I haven't embraced it the past couple of years, but I'm ready to do so, and capture these memories to look back on. 

March 24, 2022

I took this week off for Spring Break to align with Andrew, and it's been nothing short of amazing. Today, we went to Arapahoe Basin, and I can officially say that I skied Zuma Bowl. We were hoping to get on Willy's Wide, but the East Wall was closed all day. I feel confident enough to ski the line, but booting up makes me a little nervous still.

We're planning on camping tomorrow night for our first winter camping trip. I'm so excited and ready to see what it's all about. It's supposed to be warmer than normal, in the 30's at night, so I'm hoping it'll be a good time to ease into it. 

This break has been bittersweet -- I wish I could live this life everyday, skiing/camping/climbing whenever we want, and I'm really hoping one day we can get to that point. I just feel so much more fulfilled doing this rather than sitting at my computer all day. 

Anyways, I hope to post some sweet trips, goals, and good recipes in between.
