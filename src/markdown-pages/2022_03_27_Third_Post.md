Biking Goals:

Mount Evans Road, Idaho Springs: 48 miles, 5,540 Feet Elevation Gain test test test

I biked around 500 feet of elevation gain today, right on track....

Today was super chill. Andrew picked up Platey this morning, had some donuts for breakfast, worked on taxes, biked, had Torchy's Tacos for dinner, worked on the blog, and will probably watch a movie tonight. I really don't want this Spring Break to end, but it makes me so excited for what's to come this summer.
