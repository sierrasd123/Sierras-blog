### 

Here's the recipe for "Choclava':

2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup light brown sugar
1 tsp. baking soda
1 1/4 tsp. kosher salt
1/2 cup canola oil (maybe coconut oil substitute)
1/4 cup + 2 Tbs. soy milk
2 Tbs. pure vanilla extract

For the topping:
3/4 cup dark chocolate chunks (Guittard recommended)
1/2 cup pistachios
1/4 cup local honey
1/4 cup apricot marmalade 
1/2 tsp. cinnamon

Directions:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F

Line a 9x9-inch square pan with parchment paper or grease with oil

Using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or spatula, combine the dry ingredients: flour, sugars, baking soda, and kosher salt. Add the wet ingredients: oil, soy milk, and vanilla. Mix until well combined. Press the dough into the prepared pan.

For the topping, place all ingredients, except the sea salt, in a bowl and combine with a spatula (Note: it will get sticky). Spread the topping evenly on top of the dough; make sure you reach all the edges. Optional: sprinkle the topping with salt.

Bake for 10 minutes, rotate the tray 180 degrees, and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool completely before cutting. Cut into 12 two-inch bars or 24 bite-size bars. Store in an airtight container for up to one week.

Enjoy!
