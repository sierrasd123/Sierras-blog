Did 100 floors on the stairmaster, hell yeah.

Went to the grocery store to pick up some new things to make. We had tortellini's with butter/pesto and veggies. I think next time I'll just do torts and red sauce. Made overnight oats for tomorrow - 2 cups oats, a little less than 2 cups of milk, vanilla, cinnamon, and a little bit of salt. We'll see how it goes!
